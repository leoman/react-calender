React Calendar project.

Please run:

### `npm start`

Some things to note about the project:

- I did not add any styling to this, as it was outside of the requirment, and not within the time limit
- There is no validation on the reminder
- This only works for the current month, therefore I never need to worry about day index clashing
- The reducer is not immutable, again this was just based on the time to write something working
